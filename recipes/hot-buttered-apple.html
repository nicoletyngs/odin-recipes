        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of the simplest recipes from <em>Breath of the Wild</em> - all that Link needs are: an apple, and goat butter. This recipe from <em>Sheikah Plate</em> is a deliciously improved version of Link's first Baked Apple, perfect for the fall season.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 apples of your favorite variety</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar, unpacked</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cloves</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon allspice</li>
            <li>sprinkle of kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375F.</li>
            <li>Wash the apples thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Using a paring knife, cut around the core of the apple straight down, being sure to leave about 1/2-1 inch at the bottom of the apple. Take a small spoon and, gently as you can, scoop out the core, ensuring you remove all the seeds and leave about 1/2-1 inch at the bottom of the hole. You may simply use an apple corer if you have one.</li>
            <li>Mix together the softened butter, sugar, and spices until completely combined.</li>
            <li>Split the mixture in half and stuff each of the apples to the top of the hole. Sprinkle with kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Heat the water in a cup in the microwave, or even on the stove, until boiling.</li>
            <li>Place the apples in an oven-safe container and pour the boiling water at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30ish minutes, or until the apples are the correct “doneness” for your tastes. You may check this by squeezing them gently, but be careful not to burn yourself.</li>
            <li>Take them out of the oven, allow them to cool slightly, and serve. If your apples are a bit stiffer you may want to slice them and allow the sauce to drizzle over each piece. If yours are softer, simply serve with a spoon.</li>
        </ol>
